# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Concepts

Welcome to my journey of learning Data Structures and Algorithms! This repository contains my notes, explanations, and examples as I explore fundamental DSA concepts. I hope this will be helpful for beginners who are also starting their DSA learning journey.

## Introduction to Data Structures

A program is a set of instructions that performs operations on data, and without data, instructions cannot be executed, which makes data an essential part of any program. 

When a program works with data, it must organize that data in main memory during execution, and this method of organizing, storing, and accessing data is known as a **data structure**. 

Depending on the requirements of the program—such as efficient access, insertion, deletion, or memory usage—we choose an appropriate data structure.

### Types of Data Structures

Data structures can be broadly classified into two categories:

#### 1. Physical Data Structures

Physical data structures define how data is actually arranged in memory, including whether memory locations are contiguous or linked through addresses.

**Examples:**
- Arrays
- Matrices
- Linked Lists

#### 2. Logical Data Structures

Logical data structures define how data is logically related and how it can be accessed or used, such as LIFO (Last In First Out), FIFO (First In First Out), hierarchical, or network-based access. Logical data structures do not directly specify memory layout and are implemented using physical data structures according to the needs of the application.

**Examples:**
- Stacks (LIFO)
- Queues (FIFO)
- Trees (Hierarchical)
- Graphs (Network-based)
- Hashing
